An eco-friendly pipeline for fine-tuning and inferencing transformer-based language models engineered to actively prevent hardware overheating.

## 1. Introduction 

Brute-force scaling of hardware-based higher computational intensity results in greater power consumption and heat generation, impacting battery life and potentially requiring more sophisticated cooling solutions. [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.14757v1) [2](https://www.eetimes.com/the-impact-of-the-end-of-moores-law-on-the-ai-gold-rush/) [3](http://www.recoverit.20m.com/whats_new_1.html)

According to the laws of thermodynamics, power consumed eventually turns into heat. Without adequate thermal management, excess heat can damage components, reduce reliability, and throttle performance.

Without effective thermal management (cooling systems), the accumulation of this waste heat leads to several critical problems. [14](https://energy.sustainability-directory.com/term/advanced-heat-dissipation/)

Electronic components are designed to operate within specific temperature ranges. Consistently running at the upper limits significantly accelerates wear and tear, drastically shortening the device's operational life. [15](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271553806_The_effect_of_temperature_on_the_reliability_of_electronic_components) [16](https://www.monolithicpower.com/en/learning/mpscholar/automotive-electronics/emc-management-in-auto-electronics/need-for-thermal-management) [17](https://cvgstrategy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/MIL-STD-810H-Method-501.7-High-Temperature.pdf)

Modern processors and electronic systems have built-in thermal protection mechanisms. When a critical temperature threshold is reached, the system intentionally slows down (throttles) its performance to reduce power consumption and generate less heat, preventing immediate damage. [18](https://cvgstrategy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/MIL-STD-810H-Method-501.7-High-Temperature.pdf) [19](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S235271022301402X) [20](https://www.windings.com/post/overcoming-technical-challenges-in-high-temperature-motor-environments/) [21](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/15/16/9099) 
[22](https://www.monolithicpower.com/en/learning/mpscholar/automotive-electronics/emc-management-in-auto-electronics/need-for-thermal-management#:~:text=Deleterious%20Effects%20on%20Materials:%20The%20rise%20in,For%20example%2C%20semiconductors%20are%20extremely%20temperature%20sensitive)

High-efficiency data centers rely on systems like cooling towers or chillers to reject the massive amount of heat generated by the GPUs.

To maintain the servers within optimal temperature ranges for performance and longevity, the cooling must be highly effective and robust.

The high power draw of high-precision LLM clusters creates a tremendous thermal load on the data center infrastructure.

The amount of electrical energy the system draws per unit of time (measured in Watts). More active components and faster switching speeds inherently draw more power.

As a significant portion of the consumed electrical power is dissipated as waste heat (due to electrical resistance and leakage currents in transistors), the faster the switching and the denser the circuitry, the more concentrated this heat becomes.

While power efficiency has increased dramatically on a "per-operation" basis compared to older architectures, the total heat generated by the newest chips is simultaneously skyrocketing due to the sheer exponential increase in computational demand and density.

The total cooling requirements have therefore not diminished; they have instead increased to unprecedented levels, requiring a revolutionary shift in cooling technology.

As chips get larger and more complex, memory bandwidth requirements explode, becoming a the dominant source of heat, 
contributing to the scale of overall Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) of a data center.

The efficiency gains have been overwhelmed by the demand for exponentially more computation, leading to a critical thermal management crisis that demands radically new cooling solutions at the software, hardware and social levels.

While the mainstream discourse often focuses on energy usage and carbon footprint of the computing sector at a global scale, the local socio-environmental consequences—such as health impacts, water usage, noise pollution, infrastructural strain, and economic burden—remain largely underexplored and poorly addressed. [23](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.03367v1)

## 2. Water Usage and its emissions

Freshwater scarcity is a global problem that requires collective efforts across all industry sectors. [24](https://arxiv.org/html/2405.17469v1) [25](https://andthewest.stanford.edu/2025/thirsty-for-power-and-water-ai-crunching-data-centers-sprout-across-the-west/)

Some data centers use water-based cooling systems, which can lead to substantial water consumption. An average Google data center consumes approximately 450,000 gallons of water per day. This can strain local water resources, especially in areas prone to drought or with limited water supply. Overall, data center cooling systems are responsible for over 40% of their electricity usage. [26](https://www.staxengineering.com/stax-hub/the-environmental-impact-of-data-centers/) [27](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.03367v1)

These facilities must operate 24/7 to prevent downtime, they rely many time on fossil fuel, like diesel generators as a failsafe during power disruptions. [28](https://www.staxengineering.com/stax-hub/the-environmental-impact-of-data-centers/) 

These diesel generators can be massive, ranging in size from 1.5 MW to over 3 MW each. Most generators are designed to provide 1.5-2 times the total connected load. These generators emit significant amounts of particulate matter (PM), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO₂), and carbon dioxide (CO₂) contribute to exacerbating the problematic current state climate change, and pose serious health risks to nearby communities and overall worlwide interconnected natural systems. [29](https://www.staxengineering.com/stax-hub/the-environmental-impact-of-data-centers/)

Data centers are not a renewable resource. The average lifespan of a data center is approximately 10-15 years and needs continuous maintenance just like a gas-powered vehicle. While the initial construction of a data center generates jobs, after its completion, the number of employees needed at the center drops by approximately 90%. So it's not only bad but also short-life-spanned, at least with current notions of datacenter design. [30](https://utulsa.edu/news/data-centers-draining-resources-in-water-stressed-communities/) [31](https://www.reccessary.com/en/news/data-centers-consume-massive-amounts-of-water)

The massive water use for cooling (evaporation in cooling towers) can strain local water resources, especially in drought-prone areas. All major ai companies have reported significant increases in water use driven by AI. 

Some cooling systems use potent fluorinated greenhouse gases (F-GHGs) as refrigerants. If these gases leak, and they eventually do, they have a global warming potential thousands of times greater than CO₂.

So, The overall environmental impact includes not only the water consumed, but also the energy used for cooling, and the water required for the power plants that supply electricity to the data centers.  [32](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2025-ai-impacts-data-centers-water-data/) [33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfRw-nV6b8M&t) [34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl1ctf1_JxE&t/) [35](https://www.reccessary.com/en/news/data-centers-consume-massive-amounts-of-water)

Prioritizing one aspect of sustainability, such as reducing carbon emissions, while neglecting another crucial resource like water, creates an illusion of sustainability. [36](https://utulsa.edu/news/data-centers-draining-resources-in-water-stressed-communities/) [37](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/data-center-ai-gpus-may-have-extremely-short-lifespans) [38](https://www.jll.com/en-us/insights/why-data-centers-could-hit-obsolescence-sooner-than-you-think) [39](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/datacenter-gpu-service-life-can-be-surprisingly-short-only-one-to-three-years-is-expected-according-to-unnamed-google-architect) [40](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2025/breaking-barriers-data-center-growth) [41](https://akfpartners.com/growth-blog/data-center-lifespan-risk)

It's actually pretty clear that we need holistic sustainability approaches that, inaddition to the emissions, also explicitly incorporate waterfootprint mitigation into its management; We need an eco-friendly, sustainable version of AI datacenters and energy power plants.

## 3. Emissions from Electricity Generation

The burning of fossil fuels for electricity, heat, and transportation
is the largest contributor to climate change, with global energy consumption accounting for over 73% of total greenhouse gas emissions. Power plants using coal, oil, and natural gas are the single largest source of these emissions.  [44](www.un.org/en/climatechange/science/causes-effects-climate-change) [45](https://www.wri.org/insights/4-charts-explain-greenhouse-gas-emissions-countries-and-sectors) [46](https://d-carbonize.eu/greenhouse-gases/comparison-ghg-emissions-sector/) [47](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/global-greenhouse-gas-overview) [48](https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/explainers/what-direct-risks-does-ai-pose-to-the-climate-and-environment) [49](https://news.mit.edu/2025/explained-generative-ai-environmental-impact-0117) [50](https://www.iea.org/energy-system/buildings/)data-centres-and-data-transmission-networks [51](https://www.npr.org/2024/07/12/g-s1-9545/ai-brings-soaring-emissions-for-google-and-microsoft-a-major-contributor-to-climate-change)

The carbon dioxide (CO₂) and other greenhouse gases emitted by the power plants generating the electricity for the datacenters and ai datacenters. [52](https://www.climateimpact.com/news-insights/insights/carbon-footprint-of-ai/) [53](https://www.staxengineering.com/stax-hub/the-environmental-impact-of-data-centers/) [54](https://www.carbonbrief.org/ai-five-charts-that-put-data-centre-energy-use-and-emissions-into-context/) [55](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004224028645)

The energy sector, including natural gas operations, is a major source of anthropogenic methane emissions, primarily from fugitive leaks during extraction, processing, and transportation. Methane is the primary component of natural gas, and unburned gas leaking into the atmosphere is a potent greenhouse gas, with a warming effect over 80 times stronger than \(\text{CO}_2\) over a 20-year period. AI Data centers use massive amounts of electricity. The environmental impact of this electricity consumption depends on the energy source used. If data centers are powered by natural gas-fired electricity, their indirect (Scope 3) emissions include the upstream methane leaks from the gas supply chain. The data center itself primarily produces \(\text{CO}_2\) from the combustion of the gas at the power plant, along with the release of other heat-trapping gases.
